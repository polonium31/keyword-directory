# Keyword-Targeted Article Directory

## Project Description

The Keyword-Targeted Article Directory is a web-based application designed to organize and manage articles based on specific keywords.

### Features

#### User Features

1. **Search:** Users can search for articles by entering keywords. The system will display a list of articles related to the entered keyword.

2. **Copy:** Users can copy the content of an article to their clipboard for easy reference.

#### Admin Features

1. **Search:** Administrators can search for articles by keywords, just like users.

2. **Edit:** Administrators have the ability to edit articles. This can be useful for correcting errors, updating information, or making improvements to the content.

3. **Delete:** Administrators can delete articles that are no longer relevant or need to be removed for any reason.

4. **Copy:** Administrators, like users, can copy the content of an article to their clipboard.

### How It Works

1. **User Access:** Users can access the system and perform searches using keywords.

2. **Admin Access:** Administrators have a separate login and can access the system with enhanced privileges.

3. **Keyword-Targeted Articles:** Each keyword is associated with a specific article. When a user searches for a keyword, the system retrieves the corresponding article.

4. **Editing and Deletion:** Administrators can make changes to articles or delete them as needed.

5. **Copy Functionality:** Both users and administrators can easily copy the content of an article for their use.
